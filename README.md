- 👋 Hello, my name is Stijn Bollen. I work for team Blaise at Statistics Netherlands.
- 👀 I’m interested in most things related to software development and deployment.
- 🌱 I’m always learning something new and keeping my knowledge up-to-date.
- 💞️ I’m currently not looking for anything new to collaborate on.
- 📫 There are many ways to reach me, but I'd rather you didn't.
